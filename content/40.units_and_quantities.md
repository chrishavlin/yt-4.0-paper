## Units and Quantities {#sec:units}

At a basic level, `yt` is an engine for converting data dumped to disk by a simulation code into a physically meaningful result.
Attaching units to simulation data makes it possible to perform dimensional analysis on the simulation data, adding additional opportunities for catching errors in a data processing pipeline.
In addition, it becomes straightforward to convert data from one unit system to another.

In `yt` 4.0 we handle units in a an automatic fashion, leveraging the symbolic math library `sympy`.
Instead of returning a NumPy `ndarray` when users query `yt` data objects for fields, return a `unyt_array`, a subclass of `ndarray`.
`unyt_array` preserves `ndarray`'s array operations, including deep and shallow copies, broadcasting, and views.
Augmenting `ndarray`, `unyt_array` attaches unit metadata to the array data, enabling runtime checking of unit consistency in arithmetic operations between `unyt_array` instances, and making it trivial to compose new units using algebraic operations.

As a trivial example, when one queries a data object (here given the generic name `dd`) for the density field, we get back a `unyt_array``, including both the simulation data for the density field, and the units of the density field, in this case $\rm{g}/\rm{cm}^3$:

```python
>>> dd['density'] 
unyt_array([4.92e-31, 4.94e-31, 4.93e-31, ...,
            1.12e-25, 1.59e-25, 1.09e-24], 'g/cm**3')
```

One of the nicest aspects of this new unit system is that the symbolic algebra for unitful operations is performed automatically by sympy:

```python
>>> print(dd['mass']/dd['cell_volume'])
  [4.92e-31 4.94e-31 4.93e-31 ... 
   1.12e-25 1.59e-25 1.09e-24] g/cm**3
```

`unyt_array` is primarily useful for attaching units to NumPy `ndarray` instances.
For scalar data, we have created the new `unyt_quantity` class.
`unyt_quantity` is a subclass of `unyt_array` with the requirement that the "array data" associated with the instance be limited to one element.
`unyt_quantity` is primarily useful for physical constants and ensures that the units are propagated correctly when composing quantities from arrays, physical constants, and unitless scalars:

```python
>>> from unyt import boltzmann_constant
>>> print(dd['temperature']*boltzmann_constant)
[1.28e-12 1.29e-12 1.29e-12 ... 
 1.63e-12 1.59e-12 1.40e-12] erg
```

If a user needs the field in a different unit system, they can quickly convert using `convert_to_units` or `in_units`.

When a `Dataset` object is instantiated, it will its self instantiate and set up a `UnitRegistry` class that contains a full set of units that are defined for the simulation. This registry includes both concrete physical units like `cm` or `K` but also units symbols that correspond to the unit system used internally in the simulation.

The new unit systems lets us to encode the simulation coordinate system and scaling to physical coordinates directly into the unit system. We do this via "code units".

Every `Dataset` has a `length_unit`, `time_unit`, and `mass_unit`, attribute that the user can quickly and easily query to discover the base units of the simulation. For example:

```python
>>> import yt
>>> ds = yt.load("Enzo_64/DD0043/data0043")
>>> print(ds.length_unit)
128 Mpccm/h
>>> print(ds.quan(1.0, "code_length").in_units("Mpccm/h"))
128.0 Mpccm/h
>>> print(ds.length_unit.in_cgs())
5.555172850264421e+26 cm
```

Optionally `velocity_unit`, `pressure_unit`, `temperature_unit`, and `density_unit` may be defined as well if the units for these fields cannot be inferred from the mass, length, and time units.

Additionally, we allow conversions to the simulation unit system.
Data in code units are available by converting to `code_length`, `code_mass`, `code_time`, `code_velocity`, `code_density`, `code_magnetic`, `code_pressure`, `code_metallicity`, or any combination of those units.
Code units preserve dimensionality: an array or quantity that has units of `cm` will be convertible to `code_length`, but not to `code_mass`.

On-disk data are also be available to the user, presented in unconverted code units.
To obtain on-disk data, a user need only query a data object using an on-disk field name:

```python
>>> import yt
>>> ds = yt.load("Enzo_64/DD0043/data0043")
>>> dd = ds.all_data()
>>> print(dd[('enzo', 'Density')])
[6.74e-02 6.12e-02 8.92e-02 ... 
 9.09e+01 5.66e+01 4.27e+01] code_mass/code_length**3
>>> print(dd[('gas', 'density')])
[1.92e-31 1.74e-31 2.54e-31 ... 
 2.59e-28 1.61e-28 1.22e-28] g/cm**3
```

Here, the first data object query is returned in code units, while the second is returned in CGS units.
This is because `("enzo", "Density")` is an on-disk field, while `("gas", "density")` is an internal `yt` field.

### Implementation {#sec:units_implementation}

Our unit system has 6 base dimensions, `mass`, `length`, `time`, `temperature`, and `angle`.
The unitless `dimensionless` dimension, which we use to represent scalars is also technically a base dimension, although a trivial one.
For convenience, we also create dimensionless unit symbols to represent quantities like metallicity that are formally dimensionless, but it is convenient to represent in a unit system.

For each dimension, we choose a base unit.
Our system's base units are grams, centimeters, seconds, Kelvin, and radian.
All units can be described as combinations of these base dimensions along with a conversion factor to equivalent base units.

The choice of CGS as the base unit system is somewhat arbitrary.
Most unit systems choose SI as the reference unit system.
We use CGS to stay consistent with the rest of the `yt` codebase and to reflect the standard practice in astrophysics.
In any case, using a **physical** coordinate system makes it possible to compare quantities and arrays produced by different datasets, possibly with different conversion factors to CGS and to code units.
We go into more detail on this point below.
In the future, we plan to make the preferred internal coordinate system a user-configurable option.

We provide sympy `Symbol` objects for the base dimensions.
The dimensionality of all other units should be `sympy` `Expr` objects made up of the base dimension objects and the `sympy` operation objects `Mul` and `Pow`.

Let's use some common units as examples: gram (`g`), erg (`erg`), and solar mass per cubic megaparsec (`Msun / Mpc`$^3$).
`g` is an atomic, CGS base unit, `erg` is an atomic unit in CGS, but is not a base unit, and `Msun/Mpc`$^3$ is a combination of atomic units, which are not in CGS, and one of them even has an SI prefix.
The dimensions of `g` are `mass` and the cgs factor is 1.
The dimensions of `erg` are `mass * length$^2`$ * `time`$^{-2}$ and the cgs factor is 1.
The dimensions of `Msun/Mpc`$^3$ are `mass / length`$^3$ and the cgs factor is about 6.8e-41.

We use the `UnitRegistry` class to define all valid atomic units.
All unit registries contain a unit symbol lookup table (dict) containing the valid units' dimensionality and cgs conversion factor.
Here is what it would look like with the above units:

```python
{ "g":    (mass, 1.0),
  "erg":  (mass * length**2 * time**-2, 1.0),
  "Msun": (mass, 1.98892e+33),
  "pc":   (length, 3.08568e18), }
```

Note that we only define **atomic** units here.
There should be no operations in the registry symbol strings.
When we parse non-atomic units like `Msun/Mpc**3`, we use the registry to look up the symbols.
The unit system in yt knows how to handle units like `Mpc` by looking up unit symbols with and without prefixes and modify the conversion factor appropriately.

We construct a `Unit` object by providing a string containing atomic unit symbols, combined with operations in Python syntax, and the registry those atomic unit symbols are defined in.
We use sympy's string parsing features to create the unit expression from the user-provided string.

`Unit` objects are associated with four instance members, a unit `Expression` object, a dimensionality `Expression` object, a `UnitRegistry` instance, and a scalar conversion factor to CGS units.
These data are available for a `Unit` object by accessing the `expr`, `dimensions`, `registry`, and `cgs_value` attributes, respectively.

`Unit` provides the methods `same_dimensions_as`, which returns True if passed a `Unit` object that has equivalent dimensions, `get_cgs_equivalent`, which returns the equivalent cgs base units of the `Unit`, and the `is_code_unit` property, which is `True` if the unit is composed purely of code units and `False` otherwise.
`Unit` also defines the `mul`, `div`, `pow`, and `eq` operations with other unit objects, making it easy to compose compound units algebraically.

The `UnitRegistry` class provides the `add`, `remove`, and `modify` methods which allows users to add, remove, and modify atomic unit definitions present in `UnitRegistry` objects.
A dictionary lookup table is also attached to the `UnitRegistry` object, providing an interface to look up unit symbols.
In general, unit registries should only be adjusted inside of a code frontend, since otherwise quantities and arrays might be created with inconsistent unit metadata.
Once a unit object is created, it will not receive updates if the original unit registry is modified.

### Creating unyt_array and unyt_quantity instances {#sec:creating-ytarray-and-ytquantity-instances}

There are two ways to create new array and quantity objects: via a constructor, and by multiplying scalar data by a unit quantity.

#### Class Constructor {#sec:class-constructor}

The primary internal interface for creating new arrays and quantities is through the class constructor for `unyt_array`.
The constructor takes three arguments.
The first argument is the input scalar data, which can be an integer, float, list, or array.
The second argument, `input_units`, is a unit specification which must be a string or `Unit` instance.
Last, users may optionally supply a UnitRegistry instance, which will be attached to the array.
If no `UnitRegistry` is supplied, a default unit registry is used instead.
Unit specification strings must be algebraic combinations of unit symbol names, using standard Python mathematical syntax (i.e.
`**` for the power function, not `^`).

Here is a simple example of `unyt_array` creation:

```python
>>> from unyt import unyt_array, unyt_quantity 
>>> unyt_array([1, 2, 3], 'cm') 
unyt_array([1, 2, 3]) cm
>>> unyt_quantity(3, 'J') 
unyt_quantity(3, 'J') 
```

In addition to the class constructor, we have also defined two convenience functions, `quan`, and `arr`, for quantity and array creation that are attached to the `Dataset` base class.
These were added to syntactically simplify the creation of arrays with the UnitRegistry instance associated with a dataset.
These functions work exactly like the `unyt_array` and `unyt_quantity` constructors, but pass the `UnitRegistry` instance attached to the dataset to the underlying constructor call.
For example:

```python
>>> import yt
>>> ds = yt.load("Enzo_64/DD0043/data0043")
>>> ds.arr([1, 2, 3], 'code_length').in_cgs() 
unyt_array([5.55e+26, 1.11e+27, 1.66e+27], 'cm')
```

This example illustrates that the array is being created using `ds.unit_registry`, rather than the `default_unit_registry`, for which `code_length` is equivalent to `cm`.

#### Multiplication {#sec:multiplication}

New `unyt_array` and `unyt_quantity` instances can also be created by multiplying `unyt_array`, `unyt_quantity`, or `Unit` instances by `float` or `ndarray` instances. 
To make it easier to create arrays using this mechanism, we have populated the `unyt` namespace with predefined `Unit` instances that correspond to common unit symbol names.
For example:

```python
>>> from unyt import meter, gram, kilogram, second, joule 
>>> kilogram * meter**2 == joule 
True
>>> from unyt import m, kg, s, W 
>>> kg*m**2/s**3 == W
True

>>> from unyt import kilometer 
>>> three_kilometers = 3*kilometer 
>>> print(three_kilometers)
3.0 km

>>> from unyt import gram, kilogram 
>>> my_g = 1.0*gram
>>> my_kg = 1.0*kilogram
>>> print(my_g+my_kg)
1001.0 g 
>>> print(my_kg+my_g)
1.001 kg 
>>> print(my_kg/my_g)
1000.0 dimensionless
```

### Handling code units {#sec:handling-code-units}

Code units are tightly coupled to on-disk parameters.
To handle this fact of life, the `yt` unit system can modify, add, and remove unit symbols via the `UnitRegistry`.

#### Associating arrays with a coordinate system {#sec:associating-arrays-with-a-coordinate-system}

To create quantities and arrays in units defined by a simulation coordinate system, we associate a `UnitRegistry` instance with `Dataset` instances.
This unit registry contains the metadata necessary to convert the array to CGS from some other known unit system and is available via the `unit_registry` attribute that is attached to all `Dataset` instances.

We have modified the definition for `set_code_units` in the `Dataset` base class.
In this new implementation, the predefined `code_mass`, `code_length`, `code_time`, and `code_velocity` symbols are adjusted to the appropriate values and `length_unit`, `time_unit`, `mass_unit`, `velocity_unit` attributes are attached to the `Dataset` instance.
If there are frontend specific code units they should also be defined in subclasses by extending this function.

#### Mixing modified unit registries {#sec:mixing-modified-unit-registries}

It becomes necessary to consider mixing unit registries whenever data needs to be compared between disparate datasets.
The most straightforward example where this comes up is a cosmological simulation time series, where the code units evolve with time.
The problem is quite general --- we want to be able to compare any two datasets, even if they are unrelated.

We have designed the unit system to refer to a physical coordinate system based on CGS conversion factors.
This means that operations on quantities with different unit registries will always agree since the final calculation is always performed in CGS.

The examples below illustrate the consistency of this choice:

```python
>>> import yt
>>> ds1 = yt.load('Enzo_64/DD0002/data0002')
>>> ds2 = yt.load('Enzo_64/DD0043/data0043')
>>> print(ds1.length_unit, ds2.length_unit)
128 Mpccm/h, 128 Mpccm/h
>>> print(ds1.length_unit.in_cgs())
6.26145538088e+25 cm
>>> print(ds2.length_unit.in_cgs())
5.55517285026e+26 cm 
>>> print(ds1.length_unit*ds2.length_unit)
145359.100149 Mpccm**2
>>> print(ds2.length_unit*ds1.length_unit)
1846.7055432 Mpccm**2
```

For the last two examples, the answer is not the seemingly trivial $128^2=16384,\rm{Mpccm}^2/h^2$.
This is because the new quantity returned by the multiplication operation inherits the unit registry from the left object in binary operations.
This convention is enforced for all binary operations on two `unyt_array` objects.
Results are always consistent when referencing an unambiguous physical coordinate system:

```python
>>> print((ds1.length_unit * ds2.length_unit).in_cgs())
3.4783466935e+52 cm**2 
>>> print(ds1.length_unit.in_cgs() * ds2.length_unit.in_cgs())
3.4783466935e+52 cm**2
```

### Handling cosmological units {#sec:handling-cosmological-units}

If we detect that we are loading a cosmological simulation performed in comoving coordinates, extra comoving units are added to the dataset's unit registry.
Comoving length unit symbols are still named following the pattern `<length symbol>cm`, i.e.
`Mpccm`.

The $h$ symbol is treated as a base unit, `h`, which defaults to unity.
The `Dataset.set_units` method updates the `h` symbol to the correct value when loading a cosmological simulation.
